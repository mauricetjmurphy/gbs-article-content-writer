```

- `config/`: This directory contains all the application configuration files, including the environment-specific configuration files and the logger configuration.

- `controllers/`: This directory contains all the controller files that handle the business logic for each route. Each controller file exports an object with functions that are mapped to specific routes in the `routes/` directory.

- `middleware/`: This directory contains all the middleware files that handle common tasks like authentication, error handling, and input validation. Middleware functions can be applied to specific routes in the `routes/` directory.

- `models/`: This directory contains all the model files that define the structure of the data stored in the database. Each model file exports a Mongoose schema that can be used to create, read, update, and delete data.

- `routes/`: This directory contains all the route files that define the API endpoints and map them to the corresponding controller functions. Each route file exports an Express Router instance that can be mounted on the main application in `app.js`.

- `utils/`: This directory contains utility functions that are used throughout the application, like database connection management and error handling.

- `app.js`: This is the main application file that creates and configures the Express app, mounts the routers defined in `routes/`, and starts the server.

- `package.json`: This file contains the project metadata and dependencies.

- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.
